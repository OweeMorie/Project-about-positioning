                            Digital art refers to any artistic work or practice that uses digital technology as part of the creative or presentation process. It can also<br> refer to computational art that uses and engages with digital media. Since the 1960s, various names have been used to describe<br> digital art, including computer art, electronic art, multimedia art, and new media art.

                            Subcategories for the art include digital painting, where artists use software to emulate techniques<br> using in physical painting, digital illustration, which involves creating rendered images for other<br> media, and 3D modeling, where artists craft three-dimensional objects and scenes. Pieces of<br>     digital art range from captured in unique displays and restricted from duplication to popular memes available for reproduction<br> in commercial products.

                            Painting is a visual art, which is characterized by the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or<br> other medium to a solid surface (called the "matrix"or "support").The medium is commonly<br> applied to the base with a brush, but other implements, such as knives, sponges, and airbrushes,<br> may be used. One who produces paintings is called a painter.

                            In art, the term "painting" describes both the act and the result of the action (the final work is called<br> "a painting"). The support for paintings includes such surfaces as walls, paper, canvas, wood,<br> glass, lacquer, pottery, leaf, copper and concrete, and the painting may incorporate multiple other<br> materials, including sand, clay, paper, plaster, gold leaf, and even whole objects.

                            Painting is an important form of visual art, bringing in elements such as drawing, composition,<br> gesture, narration, and abstraction. Paintings can be naturalistic and representational (as in still<br> life and landscape painting), photographic, abstract, narrative, symbolistic (as in Symbolist art),<br> emotive (as in Expressionism) or political in nature (as in Artivism).
